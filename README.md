## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have `pandas` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas

3.(Optional) â€“ .gitignore
Since I'm working on this using Git in VS Code, I added a .gitignore file to avoid pushing unnecessary files. Here's what I included:
__pycache__/
*.pyc
This keeps the repo clean by skipping compiled Python files and cache folders.

4. (Optional) â€“ requirements.txt
Since I'm using the pandas library in my script, I created a requirements.txt file with:
pandas
This makes it easy for those who want to install the needed packages by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Output
The script will create a file called Expenses_in_SouthZone_Detailed.csv with:
Itemized expenses
Categories

Total spent and remaining balance
